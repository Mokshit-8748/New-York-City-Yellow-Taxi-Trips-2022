# Case Study: NYC Yellow Taxi Trips 2022 – Data-Driven Insights & Dashboard

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive case study analyzing New York City’s Yellow Taxi Trips data for the year 2022. Leveraging an interactive dashboard and detailed datasets, the project uncovers key trends in rider behavior, payment methods, fare structures, and tipping practices to inform urban mobility decisions.

Our analysis aims to support city planners, transportation policymakers, taxi operators, and related stakeholders in understanding patterns that can drive better fleet management, policy formation, and customer service improvements.

The dashboard offers a professional overview of key metrics such as total trips, total revenue, tip amounts, passenger counts, payment methods, temporal trends, and the longest trips.

## Key Takeaways: Questions & Answers

**Q1: Who are the majority of NYC yellow taxi riders—solo, pairs, or groups?**  
**A:** Solo riders (single-passenger trips) make up the vast majority of all rides and revenue, indicating that most taxi journeys in NYC are by individuals.

**Q2: What is the dominant payment method for taxi fares?**  
**A:** Credit cards are by far the most popular payment method, signifying a highly digital, cashless customer base.

**Q3: How do NYC riders typically tip their drivers?**  
**A:** Most riders tip in the highest bracket (20%+), while only a small percentage give tips below 5%, showing that high tipping is not that rare.

**Q4: When does yellow taxi demand peak in NYC?**  
**A:** Demand spikes during the evening rush hours (5–8 PM), suggesting optimal periods for fleet deployment and pricing strategies.

**Q5: Are most taxi rides long, short, or somewhere in between?**  
**A:** Nearly all rides are short to moderate in distance; very long trips are rare but have a significant revenue impact.

**Q6: Does the number of passengers per trip influence fare and tipping behavior?**  
**A:** Yes—one and two-passenger rides tend to have higher average fares and tipping percentages than larger groups, who pay and tip less per person.

**Q7: What improvement opportunities does the dashboard reveal for the taxi system?**  
**A:** The findings highlight opportunities such as dynamic pricing during peak times, better targeting of digital payment promotion, education for tipping, and optimizing fleet allocation to solo travelers.
